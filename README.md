## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `LED_Button_Control.ino` in the Arduino IDE.  
2. Connect your Arduino Uno to your circuit:
   - Buttons → Pins 5, 6, 7
   - LEDs → Pins 2, 3, 4
   - GND and 5V to breadboard rails
3. Upload the code to your board.  
4. Press each button to activate its corresponding LED.

📌 Expected behavior:
- Button 1 lights LED 1  
- Button 2 lights LED 2  
- Button 3 lights LED 3
